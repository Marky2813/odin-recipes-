    <strong>DESCRIPTION:</strong>
    Peri Peri fries are a zesty and spicy twist on classic French fries. Coated in a blend of peri peri seasoning—a mix of chili, garlic, and other spices—these fries are known for their bold, tangy, and slightly spicy flavor. Often served with a side of cooling dip like garlic mayonnaise or ranch, peri peri fries offer a delicious kick and a vibrant taste experience. They’re perfect as a snack or a flavorful side dish and also it is quite easy to prepare.

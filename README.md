Hi there, 
This is gonna be my very first project in the web development journey and i have used the following skills while making this project:
1. basic html (boilerplate,headings)
2. linking to other html pages and adding images to html 
3. using of strong and em elements which are useful in SEOs and also along with that simply using b/i elements just for appearence 
4. ai created photos with my own face on it just for fun :)
Overall a very fun project and i enjoyed it
